# 2020-01-17 Goals

Originally litsdb-go is created for xephon-b for benchmarking different tsdb.
I want to have clients with fine grained control so I can tell how much time is spent on serialization and how much time is spent on server processing.
Having libtsdb-go can reduce number of dependencies and potential dependency conflict.

Now things has changed for both xephon-b and libtsdb-go.

For xephon-b, it can build dedicated binary that imports other tsdb's engine directly to see performance without the network layer.
Or with a more efficient network layer, e.g. binary, grpc etc.
Each binary can have their own go mod and import xephon-b common library to avoid dependency problem.

For libtsdb-go, supporting different tsdb wire protocol without external dependency is still very useful.
Besides benchmark, it can be used to implement drop in replacement for existing tsdbs for new tsdbs.
However, more common components like popular compression algorithms (gorilla tsz, delta encoding) is more libraryish.
Originally I think support decoding on disk format of tsdbs is useful for buck import/export. 
Then I realized it's much easier to use their own code to do that ...

In conclusion the tasks left for the libtsdb-go repo are

- data model
- compression
- client
- server protocol
