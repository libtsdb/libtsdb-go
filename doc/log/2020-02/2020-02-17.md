Didn't spent time on libtsdb for about two weeks (due to playing WOT ...).
Double delta part on timestamp is finished, most time is spent on writing a bit stream writer/reader.

go-tsz would change the underlying byte slice so prometheus modified it because they are using mmap.
Though their iterator still need to reset to be able to use again.

## TODO

- [ ] survey: how is primitive type stored and what happens during cast
  - [x] big endian, small endian
    - network order is big endian
    - [x] CPU, disk? intel, amd? Most CPUs are little endian, disk can be whatever you want.
  - [ ] int, unsigned int
    - the unsigned int to int conversion (why it worked in code)
    - [ ] `2s complement` as mentioned by Haiyu
    - [ ] shift behavior on signed and unsigned
  - [ ] float64
    - [ ] how is it saved
    - [ ] what happens when casting from float64 to uint64
- [ ] prometheus
  - [ ] what would happen to its xorAppender when appending time out of order
  - [ ] finalize the stream, it seems it is writing number of samples at the end of stream ...

## Endianness

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness

- big endian, e.g. 1024 is `2^10`, big endian `100` `0000_0000`, small endian `0000_0000` `100`
- network use big endian

> A big-endian ordering places the most significant byte first and the least significant byte last,
> while a little-endian ordering does the opposite

> big-endianness is the dominant ordering in networking protocols
> little-endianness is the dominant ordering for processor architectures and their associated memory
> File formats can use either ordering

> programming languages use big-endian digit ordering for numeric literals 
> as well as big-endian language (“left” and “right”) for bit-shift operations, 
> regardless of the endianness of the target architecture

## Sign

CSAPP Chapter 2: Representing and Manipulating Information covers all of them (guess I need two bookmarks now)

- use hexadecimal notation, 1 byte is from 0x00 to 0xFF, each digit is actually 4 bits, 0xFF is `1111_1111`
- `(unsigned char*) &x` to cast a value to byte array in C, see [show_bytes.c](../../../playground/primitive/c/show_bytes.c)
- `man ascii` to show ascii table
- 2.1.9 Shift Operations in C
  - right shift has `logical` and `arithmetic`
  - logical, fill left with 0
  - arithmetic, fill left with most significant bit
  - in C, signed is shift arithmetically, unsigned is shift logically
  - in Java, `>>` is arithmetic right shift, `>>>` is logical shift
- 2.2. Integer Representations
  - unsigned encoding is unique, bijection
  - signed integer is using **two's complement** most significant bit is for the negative value, rest if for the positive, e.g. for 4 bits value `1000` is `-2^3`, `1001` is `-2^3 + 1 = -7`
    - NOTE: first bit is not a sign bit, i.e. `1001` is not `-1` but `-8 + 1 = -7`, `-1` is actually `1111`
      - i.e. it is not *sign magnitude* (P68 in book)
  - 2.2.4 Conversions between Signed and Unsigned
    - the underlying bits are not changed
    - signed to unsigned
      - if x > 0, same
      - if x < 0, x + 2^w (where w is number of bits)
    - unsigned to signed
      - if first bit is 0, same, i.e. x < 2^(w-1)
      - if first bit is 1, x - 2^w
  - 2.2.6 Expanding the Bit Representation of a Number

## Double delta signed to unsigned logic explained

```go
dod := int64(delta - e.delta)

case dod <= 64 && dod >= -63:
    e.bs.writeBits(uint64(dod), 7)

func uint2int(v uint64, sz int) int64 {
    // if it is a positive number, tha max is 1 << (sz - 1), e.g. 64 = 2^6 = 2^(7-1)
    // if it is larger than that, then is was bits for a negative number
    // e.g. -63 is -2^63 + (2^63 - 63), 
    // 63 is 2^6 - 1 = 0001_1111
    // 2^64 - 63 is  ...111 1111 1111
    //                    - 0001 1111
    //                      1110 0000
    // because we only saved 7 bits, we read a uint64 which is
    // 00..... ...........  0110 0000
    //                    - 1000 0000
    // TODO: got signed value from unsigned math ...                       
	if v > (1 << (sz - 1)) {
		// or something
		v = v - (1 << sz)
	}
	return int64(v)
}
