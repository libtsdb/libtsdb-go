Decided to dig more into prometheus for the following. Might look at victoria metrics as well.

- the tsz compression it is using
- its query language
- query execution

Should be able to have

- tsz compression in go & rust for libtsdb
- run embed benchmark for prometheus (there is a tsdb/cmd/tsdb benchmark)

## TODO

- [ ] tsz compression, at least a double delta example
